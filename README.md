# DEVELOPER NOTES
### Read before updating repo.
Make sure that you download the latest repo version before updating the files. 

#### PpS:
The PpS is there to display how many Presents you get per second without having to click. I agree we need a Presents per Click display, but it's too confusing to have our current setup. If you could revert it, PerryPlaysMC, that would be great. I'll work on a PpC counter/display.

# Christmas Clicker
 *We need presents! Are you up for the task?*

# Objective
Make presents for all the little girls and boys of the world. 

# How to play
To start, download Christmas Clicker, or find online at [thewarhawk2005.github.io/Christmas-Clicker](thewarhawk2005.github.io/Christmas-Clicker). 

## The Screen
First, get aquainted with the layout of the game. There will be a Big Present in the center of the screen. Clicking this will give you a present. Below the present there is a counter that displays the number of presents you have. Below this is your present-per-second counter, and below _this_ is the shop. Buy the things in the shop to help you make more presents faster.

## The Shop
The shop is home to many items. Each item has a name, a description, a cost, and a gain. There can be manual and timed items. For example, the first upgrade is the Hammer. It costs 100 presents, but will give you one extra present per click. Now, instead of getting 1 present per click, you'll get 2.

### Manual
Manual shop items are ones like the Hammer and Drill. They increase the number of presents per click.
### Timed
Timed upgrades increase your presents per second (or "PpS"). You will start the game with 0 PpS, but if you buy something like the igloo, you will start to gain presents automatically, without having to click. 

**Note** that your PpS is displayed below the Present counter.
